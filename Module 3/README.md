# Overview

## Description of Software
### Hangman Game

This program allows users to play the classic game of Hangman.
It randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words and
presents the user with a series of underscores representing the
letters in the word. The user can make guesses by entering one
letter at a time, and the program will provide feedback on the
correctness of the guess. If the guess is correct, the letter
will be revealed in the word. If the guess is incorrect, a part
of the hangman figure will be drawn. The user has a limited number
of guesses to guess the word correctly before the hangman figure
is complete. If the user guesses the word correctly, they win the
game. If the hangman figure is complete before the word is guessed,
the user loses the game.

## Purpose of the Software
The Hangman software is a fun and interactive game designed to entertain
users by challenging their word-guessing skills. It provides an enjoyable
experience where players can test their knowledge and have fun trying to
uncover hidden words.
