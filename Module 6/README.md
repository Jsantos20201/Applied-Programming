# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

## Description of Software
The Tic Tac Toe Game is a Java-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where a player competes against a computer opponent on a 3x3 grid. The game offers a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Swing library, making it visually appealing and easy to play.

### Features
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The game provides an intuitive and visually engaging GUI. The 3x3 grid is represented as buttons that players can click to make their moves.

2. **Player vs. Computer**: The game is designed for single-player mode only. The human player takes the role of 'X', while the computer opponent represents 'O'. Players take turns placing their marks on the grid to outwit the computer.

3. **Winning Condition**: After each move, the game checks for a winner. A player wins if they have three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the game board.

4. **Draw Condition**: If all cells on the game board are filled, and no winner is determined, the game results in a draw.

5. **Valid Move Detection**: The program ensures that players can only place their marks in empty cells on the grid. Invalid moves are detected, and the player is prompted to try again.

6. **Game Reset**: After a game ends (either by a win, draw, or invalid move), the player can click the "OK" button to start a new game against the computer without needing to restart the application.

7. **Simple AI Strategy**: The computer AI employs a straightforward strategy. It attempts to win if possible, and if not, it tries to block the player from winning. If neither is possible, the computer makes a random move.

## Purpose of the Software
The purpose of the Tic Tac Toe Game software is to provide an interactive and enjoyable single-player experience, where users can play the classic Tic Tac Toe game against a computer opponent. The software aims to entertain users by recreating the familiar board game in a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java and the Swing library.
