# Overview

## Description of Software
The software is an English to Portuguese dictionary. In this program, the user can search a Portuguese word by typing in the terminal an English word. The program will search the Portuguese word of the English word through a text file called "dictionary.txt". When the program finds the correct translation of the English word, it will display to the user in the terminal a Portuguese word.

## Purpose of the Software
The purpose of this software is to educate myself in the fundamentals of the programming languague called C++ by creating this English to Portuguese Dictionary program.
