# Overview

## Description of Software
This program is an Expense Tracker application designed to help users track their expenses, 
categorize spending, generate reports, set budgets, and provide visual representations of 
spending patterns over time. The program allows users to interact with the application by 
selecting various options.

The program makes use of the Expense data class to represent individual expenses, storing 
information such as the amount, category, and date of each expense. The ExpenseTracker class 
encapsulates the logic for managing expenses, including adding expenses, calculating the total 
expense, retrieving expenses by category, generating expense reports, and saving/loading data 
to/from a file.

The user is prompted to enter their username and expense data is loaded from a file if available. 
The main program runs in a loop, presenting a menu of options for the user to choose from. The user 
can add an expense, view the total expense, view expenses by category, generate an expense report, 
save expense data to a file, or exit the program.

## Purpose of the Software
